## Order Book Trading
An ​order book​ is a list of orders indexed by ​price level ​that an exchange platform uses to record the interest of buyers and sellers. An entry in the book can be a ​buy order​ (bid) or a ​sell order (ask) and contains information about the price and quantity of the asset being traded. An ​order book row​ corresponds to a price level and may consist of several orders grouped within that price level.
