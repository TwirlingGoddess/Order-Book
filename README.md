## Order Book Trading
An ​order book​ is a list of orders indexed by ​price level ​that an exchange platform uses to record the interest of buyers and sellers. An entry in the book can be a ​buy order​ (bid) or a ​sell order (ask) and contains information about the price and quantity of the asset being traded. An ​order book row​ corresponds to a price level and may consist of several orders grouped within that price level.

There are two fundamental ways to execute an order: ​market​ and ​limit​. A ​market order​ is expected to execute as quickly as possible at the last traded price. On the other hand, a ​limit order​ indicates the minimum selling or maximum buying price. A limit order is executed only if the matched order is equal to or higher than the minimum selling price OR equal to or lower than the maximum buying price.
